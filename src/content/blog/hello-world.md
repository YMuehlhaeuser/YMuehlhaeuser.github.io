Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

## Why a personal site?

I've always believed that owning your own space on the web matters. Social platforms come and go,
algorithms change, but a personal site is yours forever.

Here I'll write about:
- **Software** — things I'm building, patterns I've discovered, tools I love
- **Photography** — the craft of seeing and capturing moments
- **Random thoughts** — ideas that don't fit neatly anywhere else

## What to expect

Posts here won't follow a schedule. I write when I have something worth saying.
Quality over quantity.

Stay curious.
